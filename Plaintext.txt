The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. 
Itâ€™s named after Julius Caesar, who used this method to protect military messages.
The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher, 
where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter that is a fixed number 
of positions away in the alphabet.
